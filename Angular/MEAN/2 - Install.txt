Downloading MEAN.JS


Cloning The GitHub Repository

You can also use Git to directly clone the MEAN.JS repository:

$ git clone https://github.com/meanjs/mean.git meanjs

This will clone the latest version of the MEAN.JS repository to a meanjs folder.
Downloading The Repository Zip File

Another way to use the MEAN.JS boilerplate is to download a zip copy of the latest MEAN.JS stable version. You can also do this using wget command:

$ wget https://github.com/meanjs/mean/archive/0.5.0.zip -O meanjs.zip; unzip meanjs.zip; rm meanjs.zip

Don't forget to rename mean-0.5.0 to your own project name.
