Make a composer.json in the root of your project (not the application folder):

{
    "require": {
        "kriswallsmith/buzz": "*"
    }
}

This will add a requirement for the Buzz package, which is a handy HTTP Request / Response PHP 5.3.x class.
Step 3

To actually install these files to your CodeIgniter project you simply run the install command:

$ composer.phar install

If you have installed via Homebrew then this will be:

$ composer install

Then you should notice composer creating a ./vendors folder in your application and code will be installed there.
Step 4

To autoload this newly installed code all you need to do is drop a single line of PHP into your index.php

include_once './vendor/autoload.php';

Done

It is as simple as that. Now in my test controller I can use Buzz happily, along with any other PSR-0 code that I install via Composer:

class Test extends CI_Controller
{
	public function index()
	{
		$browser = new Buzz\Browser();
		$response = $browser->get('http://www.google.com');

		echo $browser->getLastRequest()."\n";
		echo $response;
	}
}
