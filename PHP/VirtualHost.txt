when I try to create in my laptop it doesn't work. I still can't figure out what's wrong. Here's what I did.

    I copy the wordpress file in this folder. This will be the path of my project
        E:\Subversion\chelle.wpblog.local

    I edit the host file
        C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

        I added it to the end of file

        127.0.0.1 chelle.wpblog.local

    Next is I enable the virtual host in Apache
        C:\wamp\bin\apache\Apache2.4.4\conf\httpd.conf

        I uncomment this

        Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

    Next is I setup the virtual host in WAMP
        C:\wamp\bin\apache\Apache2.4.4\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf

        I add this at the bottom

        <VirtualHost *:80>
            ServerName chelle.wpblog.local
            ServerAlias chelle.wpblog.local
            DocumentRoot "E:/Subversion/chelle.wpblog.local/"
            <Directory "E:/Subversion/chelle.wpblog.local/">
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride All
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all    
            </Directory>
        </VirtualHost>

    Last is restart wampserver and open the chelle.wpblog.local in the browser. And it doesn't display. It display only google search results.
